title: Building the Pause Button
description: What would an AI Pause look like? How do you continue to actually prevent a superintelligence from being created?
---

If we allow the creation of a superintelligent AI, we are [risking every single life on earth](/xrisk).
When we're talking about a Pause, we're talking about [implementing an international ban on the creation of a superintelligent AI](/proposal).
Some argue that it's too early to press the Pause Button, but most experts seem to agree that it may be good to pause if developments go too fast.
But as of now _we do not have a Pause Button_.
So we should start thinking about how this would work, and how we can implement it.

## The need for international cooperation

We do not expect any single country to be able to implement a Pause.
The economic incentives are too strong, and slowing down AI development would put a country at an economic and geopolitical disadvantage.
The costs of underinvesting in safety are distributed globally, while the benefits of speeding up are local.
This game-theoretic problem is sometimes referred to as "Moloch", or a "Race to the Bottom".

The only way out is to have an _international agreement_.
That's why we're so obsessed with [summits](/summit): these are the events where global decision makers come together and work on a global solution..
We need

## Compute governance

To train a frontier LLM (like GPT-4), you need a lot of highly specialized and costly hardware.
GPT-4 was trained on 25,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs, which cost $10.000 each.
And many expect AI models to become even larger in the future.

It is hard to overstate the complexity and interdependency of the AI chip supply chain.
This is great news for governance.
Through the hardware, we can regulate the training runs.

### ASML - the lithography bottleneck

All modern chips are made using lithography machines: huge machines, costing 200 million dollars each, that project light onto a silicon wafer.
This lithography process is one of the most complex and expensive parts of the chip manufacturing process.
Top-tier AI chips are all made using EUV lithography, and ASML is the only company that makes these machines.
This Dutch company is one of the most important potential choke points for AI governance.

### SMIC - the Chinese competitor that is catching up

The Chinese company SMIC is trying to catch up, but is not able to make their own EUV machines.
Due to US / NL export controls, SMIC is not able to buy ASML EUV machines, and are now also restricted in buying the older DUV machines.
In June 2024, a [report](https://evertiq.com/news/55926) showed that SMIC can produce 5nm chips using DUV hardware,
and is now able to produce 7nm AI chips (about three years behind the 4nm process that ASMLs EUV machines can produce), but SMIC's EUV lithography is plagued by low yields.

## Preve

If we want to regulate AI training runs through hardware,

At this point only one company is dominating the industry: Nvidia.
But this

Only one company is able to manufacture the chips: TSMC.
Only one company creates the lithography machines: ASML.

This all means that the supply chain for creating these AI models is very centralized, which means it is relatively easy to control.
Implementing GPU export controls, and keeping track of sales would be a good first step.

But as Moore's Law continues, the bar will be lowered for creating these models.
If it turns out to be hard to make AI provably safe, the pause may need to take many years.
Not only will the hardware become cheaper and more performant, we can also expect more efficient algorithms to be developed (we'll talk about this later).
This means that we'll need to tighten regulation as time goes on.

At some point, we should no longer allow hardware to become more capable.
The risk of creating a superintelligent AI could be too high.

## How do we regulate software used for training AI?

The Transformer architecture revolutionized the field of AI.
This new parallelized design allowed AI models to be scaled up way higher, at a much lower cost, while giving better results.
The software side of things is a lot more difficult to control.
Software is just information - it can be copied and distributed very easily.
