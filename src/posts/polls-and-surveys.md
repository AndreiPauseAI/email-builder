description: How much do regular people and experts worry about AI risks?

## Catastrophic risks from AI

- **AI researchers** on average, give "really bad outcomes (such as human extinction)" a [14% probability](https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/), with a median of 5%. Only 18% believe the control problem is not important.
- **AI safety researchers** give this [about 30% probability](https://web.archive.org/web/20221013014859/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QvwSr5LsxyDeaPK5s/existential-risk-from-ai-survey-results).
- **UK citizens** think there's a [9% probability](https://publicfirst.co.uk/ai/) humans will go extinct because of AI. About 50% of say they're very or somewhat worried about this.

## Regulations & governance

- [**US citizens, RethinkPriorities**](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ConFiY9cRmg37fs2p/us-public-opinion-of-ai-policy-and-risk): 50% support a pause, 25% oppose a pause.
- [**US citizens, YouGov**](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/18/23836362/ai-slow-down-poll-regulation): 72% wants AI to slow down, 8% wants to to speed up.
- [**US citizens, YouGov**](https://theaipi.org/poll-shows-voters-oppose-open-sourcing-ai-models-support-regulatory-representation-on-boards-and-say-ai-risks-outweigh-benefits-2/): A new poll shows 73% of voters believe AI companies should be held liable for harms from technology they create, 67% think the AI models’ power should be restricted, and 65% believe keeping AI out of the hands of bad actors is more important than providing AI’s benefits to everyone.
- [**US CS professors, Axios Generation Lab**](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/05/ai-regulations-expert-survey): About 1 in 5 predicted AI will "definitely" stay in human control. The rest were split between those saying AI will "probably" or "definitely" get out of human control and those saying "probably not."
. Just 1 in 6 said AI shouldn't or can't be regulated. Only a handful trust the private sector to self-regulate.
