## Why we protest

AI is rapidly becoming more powerful, far faster than virtually any AI scientist has predicted.
Billions are being poured into AI capabilities, and the results are staggering.
New models are [outperforming humans](/sota) in a lot of domains.
As capabilities increase, so do the [risks](/risks).
Scientists are even [warning](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk) that AI might [end up destroying humanity](/xrisk).

Our politicians are not taking this topic remotely as seriously as they should.
We need our leaders to listen to these warnings.
We need them to take action and [implement a pause](/proposal) to stop this suicide race.

We want the Dutch government to:

- Invite AI safety experts to inform parliament of these risks
- Schedule a debate on the existential risks of AI
- Prioritize preparations for the AI safety summit later this year, and take a leading role in working toward effective policy
- Collaborate internationally to orchestrate sufficient safety measures on a global scale
