## Why we protest

AI is rapidly becoming more powerful, far faster than virtually any AI scientist has predicted.
Billions are being poured into AI capabilities, and the results are staggering.
New models are [outperforming humans](/sota) in a lot of domains.
As capabilities increase, so do the [risks](/risks).
Scientists are even [warning](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk) that AI might [end up destroying humanity](/xrisk).

Our politicians are not taking this topic remotely as seriously as they should.
We need our leaders to listen to these warnings.
We need them to take action and [implement a pause](/proposal) to stop this suicide race.
