It's happening. Our second international protest.
The goal: convince the few powerful individuals (ministers) who will be visiting the next AI Safety [Summit](/summit) (the 22nd of May) to be the adults in the room.
It's up to us to make them understand that [the risks](/risks) are too large to ignore, that they are the only ones who have the power to fix the problem.
