## Why is Local Organizing Important?

Local organizing—working with groups of volunteers in local communities to advance a cause—is the heart and soul of the PauseAI movement. We have volunteers in dozens of cities around the world, and we expect this number to grow.

Effective local organizing can be much more impactful than ineffective organizing. We’ve seen the impact that effective organizing can have, as shown by the grassroots movements that have changed the course of history. In other words, it’s important to do this right.

This guide will walk you through the ins and outs of local organizing, such as recruiting volunteers, staging events, building coalitions, and more. You should come away from this guide armed with these tools and prepared to become a local organizer.

Good luck. The future is yours.

## Developing a Local Campaign Plan

One pitfall that organizers sometimes make is starting action without a clear plan. This can lead to unfocused efforts. It’s important to come up with a plan: what are your goals, and what steps are you going to take to get there?

### Goals

What do you ultimately want to accomplish? These are your **goals**.

Possible goals could include:
- Raising awareness of AI risks in your community
- Convincing elected officials to publicly support an AI moratorium
- Building public support and generating public attention around an AI moratorium

### Tactics

Working backwards from these goals, how will you accomplish them? These are your **tactics**.

- Your specific tactics come from the strategy you choose. Initial strategies can be fairly high-level, e.g. “I will build up a team of volunteers and get them to help run public outreach events.”
- Possible tactics could include:
  - Working with teams of volunteers
  - Building alliances with community groups
  - Running public education events on AI risk
  - Generating letters, phone calls, and public comments to elected officials
  - Writing to news outlets
  - Meeting directly with elected officials’ offices

### Personal Fit

Where do you fit into all of this? You don’t want to bite off more than you can chew. Useful questions to ask yourself include:

- How many hours per week do I want to spend on this?
- What are my skills?
- What are my shortcomings?

### Other Best Practices for Campaign Planning

- Make sure each of your preferred tactics fits into your overall goal.
- Assign numerical values to your goals and tactics to make planning more concrete.
- Your campaign plan doesn’t need to be extremely specific but should provide a clear sense of what you’re trying to accomplish and how you envision getting there.

### Sample Campaign Plan

**Goal**: Convince my U.S. Representative and Senators to publicly support an international treaty establishing a moratorium on frontier AI development.

**Strategy**:
1. Build public visibility of AI risk.
2. Directly pressure elected officials to support an AI moratorium.

**Tactics**:
- Publish 10 op-eds and letters to the editor in local newspapers.
- Generate 50 phone calls and 50 letters from constituents to their Congressional offices.
- Hold events, such as talks and protests, open to the public and meant to receive media coverage.
- Meet directly with Congressional offices and introduce our policy proposals.

**What I Can Do as a Local Organizer**:
- Recruit volunteers to help implement these tactics.
- Delegate tasks to volunteers.
- Plan events with volunteer buy-in.
- Schedule meetings with Congressional offices.

## Recruiting Volunteers

Once you have a clearer sense of your plan, it’s time to find volunteers for your local group.

### Online Recruitment

- Create pages for your group on platforms like Facebook and EventBrite.
- Include information about your group, its goals and initiatives, and how community members can get involved.
- Share posts on upcoming events with your network.

### One-on-One Outreach

- The best volunteers are often people you already know—friends, classmates, coworkers, colleagues.
- Introduce PauseAI to your personal network and get interested people more involved.
- Have a clear ask to get volunteers immediately involved.

### Flyering and Tabling

- Hand out flyers to passersby with more information about PauseAI and how to get involved.
- For more information on how to make these efforts go well, read [PauseAI’s flyering guide](/flyering).

### Outreach to Other Groups and Organizations

- Reach out to existing advocacy groups.
- Types of groups to reach out to include AI safety groups, environmental and climate policy groups, local Effective Altruism chapters, labor organizations, and other advocacy groups.
- Craft a compelling outreach message explaining PauseAI and your goals.

### Outreach to College Professors

- Reach out to college professors from relevant departments and ask them to spread the word about your group.
- Email professors introducing yourself, explaining the relevance of PauseAI to their students, and asking them to share information about your chapter.

## Working with Volunteers

Once you’ve recruited a group of volunteers, it’s time to work with them on the campaign.

### Characteristics of a Well-Run Local Group

A well-run group of volunteers:
- Has a clear sense of their responsibilities
- Is plugged into the group as a whole, attends group meetings, and works well with other volunteers
- Works on tasks that interest them and that they enjoy
- Feels empowered and agentic

### One-on-One Meetings with Volunteers

- Meet with new volunteers early on.
- Get to know volunteers on an individual level; understand their interests and motivations.
- Provide additional context and share your local group’s vision.
- Determine what kinds of work volunteers are interested in.
- Pitch volunteers on specific roles and responsibilities.

### Team-Wide Meetings

- Get the whole group together periodically.
- Share team-wide updates, discuss priorities, and plan events and initiatives.
- Ensure good facilitation, set standards around decision-making, regulate discussion flow, keep meetings focused and on time, and introduce open questions.

### Team Member Responsibilities and Division of Labor

Encourage different volunteers to take on different roles based on their interests.

## Overcoming Obstacles in Local Organizing

### Obstacle 1: Difficulty Getting Your Group Off the Ground

- Use your personal network as much as possible.
- Make sure you have a very strong pitch when flyering.
- Flyer in high population-density areas.
- Ensure your messages and emails to groups are clear and direct with a specific request.

### Obstacle 2: Lack of Focus

- Schedule additional one-on-one meetings to firm up volunteers' roles and responsibilities.
- Restructure meeting agendas to include concrete planning.
- Check in with volunteers between meetings.

### Obstacle 3: Group “Fizzles Out” Due to Waning Interest from Volunteers

- Make sure volunteers feel empowered and agentic.
- Ensure volunteers are involved in actions they enjoy.
- Maintain a strategy of continuous recruitment.
