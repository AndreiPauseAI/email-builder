## How to set up a PauseAI National Group

1.  Reach out to the Oversight team at PauseAI global. They can help with funding, support, materials.
1.  Create materials
    1.  **Logo**, you can use [the figma](https://www.figma.com/design/iQ4PHQTi1vAVmT9Lckazqt/PauseAI-designs---editable?node-id=1592-2&node-type=FRAME&t=YjKyxVz4Y16aEfJ6-0) which contains some examples for other countries
    1.  **Flyer** (again, figma!). Ask for help if you need it. More flyers can be found in the [public drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bQ_MZ8giK-Mee4ABkO0BgcFInaXruNpa)
    1.  **Website**? You can do this in three ways:
        1.  Wait until PauseAI.info offers automated translations. Perhaps you can have your own page on the pauseai.info website. E.g. [PauseAI NYC](https://pauseai.info/nyc-action).
        1.  Clone the PauseAI github repo, translate it and adjust to taste! We can help host it if needed.
