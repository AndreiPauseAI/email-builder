## Current financial situation

Almost every person working on PauseAI is doing so voluntarily, so our burn rate is very low.
We have around â‚¬90k in the bank.
See who is funding PauseAI on our [funding page](/funding).
All funding that we receive will be used to accelerate our growth and increase our impact.

- Organize an online summit on AI risks and governance.
