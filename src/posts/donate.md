description: With your financial support we can have a bigger impact.

We started PauseAI as a group of volunteers, who work on it in their free time.
Since February 2024, PauseAI is a [registered non-profit foundation](/legal).
We do not yet have sufficient funds to hire people to work full-time on PauseAI, so we still run on volunteer work.
With your financial support, we can professionalize and have a bigger impact.

## How we use your donations

- **Events**: renting a location, catering, travel costs.
- **Software**: email, website, etc.
- **Campaigns**: online advertising, materials
