## AI is and is going to be really beneficial.

It could be. But it also could be [quite problematic](/risks). Both aspects have to be taken into account before developing a technology. We think we could really understand how to do that safely if we had more time.

## The biggest risks that you fear doesn’t exist

Someone could believe this for various reasons, and some responses to those beliefs are [here](/ai-x-risk-skepticism). 

At the end of the day, the important thing is to make an estimation of how likely you think they are, compare it with [the ones from experts](/polls-and-surveys#catastrophic-risks-from-ai), and if you have estimations quite different from them, think about if you can justify that difference. At the end, think if that final estimation for something so terrible can be justifiable, or if we shouldn’t do something about it.

## A Pause would be bad

Some ways in which a pause could be bad and how we could prevent that is explained on [this page](/mitigating-pause-failures). But if that doesn’t cover your worries you can tell us about them [here](https://airtable.com/appWPTGqZmUcs3NWu/pagIvo9Sv6IDHaolu/form).

## Trying to get a Pause is a waste of time

Trying to predict the future accurately seems more difficult than getting a Pause. Our views on why we think it’s possible are [here](/feasibility). And given how necessary it seems, we should try it even if it’s unlikely.

## All this sounds good but I can’t make a difference/ other

At the heart of the problem we think there are mainly psychological reasons and emotions that get in our way of not working on the problem, not logical. Some cases could be true, for sure, but most of the time they are complex excuses. Some actions are low effort, everyone can do, and have [lots of potential](/action). 

You can read about those mental obstacles [here](psychology-of-x-risks), and with the help of the community you can have more impact and an environment who actually appreciate your work mitigating these risks. This is not your job, my job, or anyone else’s. But that neglectedness is actually the reason why you can make a difference at the start of this promising movement.
