## Organizing a protest

- [Join our discord](https://discord.gg/2XXWXvErfA) to discuss organizing a protest. We're happy to help you with advice and resources!
- Make sure you write a press release and send it to the media. Read more about [how to write a press release](/writing-press-releases).
- Find coalition partners, and get as many people to join as possible.
- Pick a fitting location and date.
- You can ask for a permit for your protest at your local government.
- Have something to hand out, like <a href="/PauseAI_flyer.pdf" target="_blank">our flyer</a>.
- Use our [figma design template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1233064002969152026) to make your own flyers / banners / posters.
- Carefully consider the text on your signs and how your pictures will look to others - they will lead a life of their own on social media.
